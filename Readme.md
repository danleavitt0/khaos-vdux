# khaos-vdux

Khaos template for local vdux components. This template is not intended to be used for redistributable components, it does not include any dependencies in its package.json or anything like that. It just defines an entry point, and bootstraps some boilerplate.

## Installation

`khaos install weo-edu/khaos-vdux component`

## Usage

`khaos create component modal`
